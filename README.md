# IMM_LIO

** IMM-LIO (Interaction Multiple Models LiDAR-Inertial Odometry) is a reliable and effective LiDAR-inertial odometry package that supports multiple filters for estimation. It mitigates LiDAR motion distortion by leveraging high-rate IMU data through a tightly-coupled approach using the IMM filter. Three models—constant velocity, acceleration, and turning rate—are employed in this work.**
